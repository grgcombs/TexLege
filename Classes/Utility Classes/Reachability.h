/*
 DDG extensions include:
 Each reachability object now has a copy of the key used to store it in a
 dictionary. This allows each observer to quickly determine if the event is
 important to them.
 
 -currentReachabilityStatus also has a significantly different decision criteria than 
 Apple's code.
 
 A multiple convenience test methods have been added. They are implemented as 
 properties. Hence, they now support KVC/KVO. KVO events are triggered
 when a network transition event occurs. (Due to the way SCNetworkReachability 
 is exposed to the application [and the way network events are totally 
 asynchronous to program events], the -willChangeValueForKey: method cannot be called 
 before the event occurs.)
 
 -touchHostWithPath: is a convenience routine to bring up the radios.
